<h2 align="center"> Integrity of Scholarship Agreement </h2>

<p>
This document constitutes an agreement by the student to
abide by the rules regarding <em> Integrity of Scholarship</em>.
All students enrolled in this course implicitly agree to abide by
these policies and will seek authorized assistance when in need
of help.

</p><p>
Plagiarism will not be tolerated in this course. Incidents of
plagiarism will be taken seriously, and could result in your expulsion from the University. 

</p><p>
Plagiarism is not only dishonest, but is self-destructive.
Authorized course assistance is available in person and via email from the 
Instructor, Teaching Assistants, lab tutors, and OASIS.
</p><p>
While you may discuss the assignments with your classmates 
(or other teams if team work is authorized by the instructor), any work
you turn in <em> must be your own.</em> 

For example, you must <b><i>not</i></b> do the following.
</p><ul>
  <li>Submit any source code written by another person, nor copy
another person's answers or writeup</li>
  <li>Submit code you have previously submitted to another course for credit
    without first obtaining permission from the instructor. 
    The same restriction holds for publicly available code that
    you haven't written. If you do get permission from the instructor
	to use the code, then you <b>must</b> cite the source, including
	a URL and/or any book that accompanies the code. Be sure to
	    give the author(s) credit, consistent with any statement
	    they require you to include in your code.
  </li><li>Take notes
taken during any discussions with classmates about an assignment.</li>
  <li>Use words or text written by someone else without citing text
    appropriately. Every figure or sentence fragment must be appropriately
    decorated with quotation marks or indention to indicate very clearly that someone
else wrote the text. In addition, the passage must be labeled with a
    citation or citation number which refers to a footnote or bibliographic
    entry.  Citing a paper once is <b>not</b> enough. 
    Remember: citations should be used to illuminate a viewpoint which
    you hold. They are not a substitute for expressing your own ideas
    in your own words.

  </li><li>Submit any portion(s) of a paper you have previously submitted for credit in

    another course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, any work you do in an exam must be your own. You must not copy
someone else's answers.</p>


<b>Each student is assumed to be familiar with the <i> UCSD Policy on Integrity of
Scholarship</i> as described in the UCSD General Catalog, and the course policy as described in this
document.</b> <b>If you have any questions about these policies, be sure to
discuss them with the instructor.</b>
<p>A student violating this policy will be reported to the appropriate
university official for administrative action, such as probation or expulsion from UCSD, in addition to any academic penalty
imposed by the instructor in the course. Academic penalties include, but are not limited to,
receiving a grade of 0 for the
assignment or test in question, receiving an 'F' for the course.
