  <h1>Midterm Regrades</h1>
  <p>If you believe there was a genuine grading mistake on your midterm, these are the instructions to get that addressed. Do not come to me directly asking for points back before you have followed the steps outlined here and received a favorable response from step 2.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Before lecture Tuesday, November 25, 8:00am:<br>
        Send an email to <a href="mailto:jdporter@ucsd.edu">me</a> with a detailed and clear description of what you believe the mistake(s) to be and how many points you think you should get back. A scan or cell phone photo may also help illustrate your point.</li>
    <li>Wait for a response from me.</li>
    <li>If the response is favorable, bring your midterm to a following lecture (before or after class) or office hours and I will fix your grade then.
  </ol>
